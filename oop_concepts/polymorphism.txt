/*
 * Polymorphism means having many forms. We can define polymorphism as the ability of a
 * message to be displayed in more than one form
 *
 * Real life example a person at the same time can have a  different characteristic. Like a man
 * at the same time is a father, a husband an employee. So the same person posses different
 * behaviour in different situations.
 *
 * 1) Compile Time Polymorphism -> Function Overloading, Operator Overloading
 * 2) Runtime Polymorphism -> Virtual Functions / Method Overriding
