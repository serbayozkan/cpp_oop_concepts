/*
 * Static Binding
 *
 * By default, matching of function call with the correct function definition
 * happens at compile time. This is called static binding or early binding or compile time binding.
 * Static binding is achived using function overloading or operator overloading.
 *
 * Dynamic Binding
 *
 * Cpp provides facility to specify that the compiler should match fuction calls with the correct
 * definition at the run time; this is called dynamic binding or late binding or run-time binding.
 *
 * Dynamic binding is achieved using virtual functions. Base class pointer points to derived class object.
 * And a function is declared virtual in base class, then the matching function is identified at run time
 * using virtual table entry
 *
